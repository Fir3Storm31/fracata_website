    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        From a young age, I have been deeply passionate about pure mathematics. I tend to see math and logic in everything I do, which naturally drew me toward problem-solving. For me, every challenge feels like a game waiting to be solved. This analytical mindset led me to develop a keen interest in the world of investing during my early high school years. By my second year, I made my first investments, and by the third, I was already exploring methods to assess a company's intrinsic value - particularly the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.<br><br>
        In my fourth year, I immersed myself in the teachings of the great value investors such as Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, and Charlie Munger, while also becoming proficient in financial statement analysis. My time abroad for a year marked a transformative period of personal growth and intense study, reinforcing my commitment to both intellectual and ethical development.<br><br>
        My strong personal values are central to who I am. I believe that "a true leader is a social architect" - a principle I strive to embody and promote in every aspect of life. This conviction has guided my active involvement in volunteer work and my membership in the Lions Club, where I contribute to community-driven initiatives.<br><br>
        Upon entering university, I immediately joined student associations focused on Value Investing, starting as an analyst and currently serving as Vice President. These experiences have not only honed my analytical skills but also strengthened my leadership capabilities. I am now focused on expanding my network and gaining real-world experience. While I initially concentrated on public markets, my interests are gradually shifting toward the private sphere, particularly in the context of Family Offices.
