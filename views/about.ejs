    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="lead">My greatest passion is pure mathematics. I tend to see math and logic in everything I do. This is why I love solving problems of any nature; to me they look as games that need to be solved. <br><br>

    I have strong personal values that I constantly try to share and spread, firmly believing in the idea that "a true leader is a social architect."</p>

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                Since my early years in high school, I became interested in the world of investing, making my first investments in my second year. In my third year, I started studying how to understand a company's value, delving into the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method.<br><br>
                From my fourth year, I began studying the great masters of value investing such as Graham, Buffett, and Munger, and became familiar with financial statement analysis. I lived abroad for a year, where I focused heavily on studying and personal growth.<br><br>
                Upon entering university, I immediately joined associations dedicated to Value Investing as an analyst and now serve as Vice President. I am currently dedicating myself to networking and seeking work experiences, having received offers from Private Equity and Consulting.<br><br>
                I have a strong focus on ethics and morals, participate in volunteer activities, and am a member of the Lions Club. I have a particular interest in the world of Family Offices, although my focus is shifting from public to private.
